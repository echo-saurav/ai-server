Ayyy I got you, bro. Sounds like you're going for that chaotic energy + absurd entertainment + a bit of WTF factor vibe. Letâ€™s make your Jellyfin the place where your friends accidentally stay till 3 AM binging.

Here's a mix of adrenaline, insane humor, action, chaos, and just straight-up madness â€” stuff thatâ€™s not ultra mainstream, but will absolutely hit hard:

ðŸ”¥ Adrenaline / Chaotic Vibes
These will get the heart pumping and give that rollercoaster feeling:

Upgrade (2018) â€“ Think John Wick meets Black Mirror, but underhyped and brutally cool.

The Man from Nowhere (2010) â€“ Korean film, kind of like a darker Taken, with âœ¨sickâœ¨ action.

Hardcore Henry (2015) â€“ Entire movie is shot like an FPS game. It's insanity in motion.

The Night Comes for Us (2018) â€“ Ultra-violent Indonesian action. Like The Raid on steroids.

Shoot â€˜Em Up (2007) â€“ Literally starts with a baby being born in a gunfight. Looney Tunes for adults.

Turbo Kid (2015) â€“ 80s post-apocalyptic BMX action with gore. Very aesthetic, very absurd.

ðŸ˜‚ So Dumb Itâ€™s Brilliant
These walk the line between genius and absolute nonsense:

MacGruber (2010) â€“ Parody of MacGyver that goes so dumb, it's a cult classic now.

Hot Rod (2007) â€“ Underrated comedy gold. Stupidly funny. Andy Samberg kills it.

Kung Fury (2015) â€“ Itâ€™s only 30 mins but packed with time travel, Nazis, dinosaurs, Thor. Yes, really.

Black Dynamite (2009) â€“ A blaxploitation parody with top-tier memes.

Rubber (2010) â€“ A killer tire goes on a murder rampage. Thatâ€™s it. Thatâ€™s the movie.

Death to Smoochy (2002) â€“ Robin Williams being psychotic and hilarious. Hidden gem.
